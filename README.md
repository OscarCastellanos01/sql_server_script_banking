## CHANGES TO THE SQL SERVER SCRIPT OF A BANK

1. IN THE **CENTRALS**, **BRANCHES**, **ATMS** TABLES THE DATA TYPE WAS CHANGED FROM INT TO SMALLINT, BECAUSE INT HAS A STORAGE CAPACITY OF 4 BYTES AND SAMLLINT HAS 2 BYTE, SO WE CONSUME LESS MEMORY.

2. THE ERROR WAS FIXED WHEN EXECUTING THE SCRIPT. A COMMA WHICH WAS MISSING IN THE FOREIGN KEYS WAS ADDED.

3. THE FOLLOWING TABLES WERE CREATED: **TYPES ACCOUNTS**, **CURRENCYS ACCOUNTS**, **TYPES TRANSACTIONS**. FOR EXAMPLE: IN THE ACCOUNTS TABLE IT ONLY HAD: CHECK (TYPE IN ('SAVINGS', 'MONETARY')) AND WHEN NEEDING TO ADD ANOTHER TYPE OF ACCOUNT THE SCRIPT OF THE DB WOULD HAVE TO BE MODIFIED, BUT WITH THE NEW TABLES, IT WILL ONLY BE NECESSARY TO CREATE ONE NEW RECORD.

4. TABLE NAME WAS CHANGED Transacctions to TRANSACTIONS
